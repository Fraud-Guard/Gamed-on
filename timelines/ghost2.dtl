"Still hearing them.
Only now, they don’t whisper — they *scream*.
They told me to send it to you, said you’d be ‘better at listening’.
I think they lied. Or maybe I just didn’t understand.
I’m sorry. I told you to play it, didn’t I?
Thought it was just another weird retro thing.
I’ve seen you here, you know. Not up close — like through glass.
But every time I try to reach you, the world loads wrong. 
If you can find me before it does that again… maybe we can leave together.
......
I’m… so tired. But the game doesn’t pause, and I can’t put the controller down."
